
This is my small java game project. Many on the game mechanics are still not polished but the game works.
The goal of this tower defense is to kill all enemies before they reach the end of the dirtway. The player 
starts each level with set credits for building battle towers.

This game has 8 levels with different map design and waves of enemies.

		<<Enemies>>

Zombies: Weak health and very slow movement

Cars: Moderate health and fast movement

Planes:	Moderate health and very fast movement

Tanks:	Very strong health and slow movement

Flying saucer: Strong health and very fast movement

		
		<<Towers>>

Gun Turret:Deals weak very fast damage, Range: very short, but continues firing after locking on target

Flak Tower: Deals moderate fast damage, Range: longer then moderate

Frosting Tower: Deals moderate damage with slowing enemy effect, Range: moderate

Corrosive Tower: Deals damage by percentage of enemy Health - best for tough enemies, Range: longer then moderate

Long Missile Tower: Very powerful rockets, Range: the whole map

Note: Towers can only be build on grass terrain (rocks, water and forests are not suitable for structures)
